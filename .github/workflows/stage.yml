  # Weird hack alert! We want to trigger stage deploys manually from feature
  # branches. Alas, GitHub will only allow workflow_dispatch on default branch.
  # To get around this we add `push:` to the workflow file, and push once to get
  # it to run. After it's run once, the GitHub CLI will list it under workflows,
  # and we can run it manually. Once it shows up, remove `push:`. Note: Any
  # changes you make to the above requires you to cycle through a push again.

  push: # <-- add, push to register, then remove
  #
  # To run:
  # gh workflow run stage --ref <branch-name> -f target=<client|server|both>
